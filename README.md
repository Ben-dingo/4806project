Milestone 1 - Learning Outcomes Management System

In this milestone we implemented a simple version of the system, but there are many issues that remain. For starters, we don't 
actually access the DB now for the searches, we must add the courses, objectives and categories dynamically at the start. We also only 
have the searches for courses now; program search or category search are yet to be implemented. We also don't mention the 'year' 
that the course is offered in yet, so the search will show all the courses (if there were multiple over multiple years). The next steps
we must take are essentially to complete all the missing features that are mentioned previously.
